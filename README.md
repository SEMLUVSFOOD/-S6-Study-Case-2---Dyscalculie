🛣️ RekenReis
An educational, gamified web-based project to help children recognize signs of dyscalculia in a fun and engaging way.

📌 Project Description
RekenReis is an interactive mini-game collection where kids, from a first-person view based on a road trip, are challenged with numbers. 

One of the minigames is to spot and remember numbers from highway signs. After a brief moment, the car stops and two numbers appear. The child has only a few seconds to select the correct number. Every correct answer rewards them with a coin (or similar reward). After several rounds, a final score is shown.

This setup makes learning fun and low-pressure while offering valuable insights into potential math difficulties like dyscalculia.

🧠 Why This Project?
This project combines multiple research findings into a playful, accessible application. By gamifying the learning experience, we aim to create a digital space where children feel safe, engaged, and motivated to learn — while allowing early detection of learning difficulties.

🔧 Technologies Used
We chose to build a web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's why:
  📱 Accessible – Works on tablets, phones, and desktops with no installation required. Can be played with just a keyboard.
  ⚡ Fast development – Languages we’re already comfortable with.
  🧩 UX/UI Focused – More time spent on design, less on heavy development.
  🌍 Platform-independent – Not tied to specific systems or hardware.
  🔁 Easy to update – Quick to iterate and test new ideas.

🧩 GitHub Setup & Conventions
As the team’s Git master, I (developer) set up the project with a clear structure and workflow:

  1. Repository Setup
    🏁 Repository name: S6_Study_Case_2__Dyscalculie
    📁 Folder structure mapped out in a Figma Jam board

  2. Branching
    🌿 Each minigame has its own dedicated branch
    🧭 A central landing page created as the game’s entry point

  3. Commit Guidelines
    ✅ Clear and concise commit messages in English
    e.g. Score calculation now works correctly in minigame JS
    ❌ Avoid vague messages like minigame fixed

✅ Current Progress
  🚗 Working prototype of the landing page 
  🗂️ GitHub folder and branch structure in place
  🎮 First two minigames prototypes initiated

🔜 Next Steps
  🧪 Research more effective minigame concepts
  🎨 Create a broader branding guide for UI and visual elements
  🧍‍♂️ User testing (ideally with children)
  📊 Refine scoring and feedback system

✨ Goal
To create a fun and meaningful digital tool that supports children in discovering possible challenges with numbers — at their own pace, in a positive and interactive way.
